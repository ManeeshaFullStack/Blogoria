# Blogoria

> A fully responsive, mobile-first static blog website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap — structured to gain real-world UI development experience using local libraries and custom scripting.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Blogoria** is a modern and elegant blog layout project developed from scratch. It features structured sections such as a hero banner, featured blog posts, author area, and a styled footer — all implemented using local HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery files along with the Bootstrap framework for responsive behavior.

> ✅  **This project was built to enhance my understanding of frontend development using a mobile-first approach, while also applying local libraries for production-like development practice. It solidified my knowledge in building responsive layouts, improving user interaction with jQuery, and structuring clean and maintainable code.**
